## Problem and Resolve
  - **Message manage**
    - **problem** is message is being sent to wrong display.
      - e.g. while in the lobby then open the private room. Now you send a message in the private room, but this message is broadcasted to both the lobby and the private room.
    - **bugs** is I stubborn to managing whole messages data in app with only one state.
    - **resolve** It took me a long time. I'm start coding a new small app from scratch using the trial and error knowledge from the main app. Until the real problem and solution are found
  - **Caching**
  - **Security**
  - **State Hook**
